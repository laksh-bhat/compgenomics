1. 	(a) Traits are usually polygenic i.e affected by several genes or variants.
	(b) The phenotype is not only influenced by the genotype; the environment also influences it. 
	(c) Then there are mutations and errors in determining the genome which makes it hard to make definitive assertions about the traits.

2.	(a) Transcription is a process whereby protein-coding stretches of DNA are transcribed into messenger RNA molecules.
	(b) Translation is a process whereby messenger RNA are fed into the ribozome, which translates the RNA nucleic acid into protein amino acids.
	(c) In simple words DNA molecules contain information about how to create proteins i.e. DNA makes RNA makes protein.
	    DNA alphabet has 4 nucleic acids, whereas protein alphabet has ~20 amino acids. Hence a redundant code - triplet of nucleic acids code for an amino acid.
	    Proteins are the workhorses which (loosely speaking) determine the traits or phenotype.

    (c) Let string S = a$b, be the string consisting of a followed by the character $ - present neither in a or b - which is then followed by b.
        Let us assume that |a| = n <= |m| (for brevity; its trivial to prove this for the case n > m). So, by definition S has a length |S| = m + n + 1.
        Compute Z_i(S) for i = 2 to n+m+1.
        (1) Looking for a in b.
        Since '$' doesn't appear in either a or b, Z_i <= n for every i > 1. Any value of i > n+1 such that Z_i(S) = n
        identifies an occurrence of a in b.
        (2) Just as in (1), for any i > n+1, if Z_i(S) > 0 constitutes a suffix of a that exactly matches a prefix of b.
            The longest such suffix is 'a' (for prefix 'b') itself as shown in (1).

    (d) The pre-processing of S is linear in the size of a and b (1.4 Gusfield).
        The main idea contributing to the linear time of the algorithm is to use the already computed Z values to accelerate the computation of Z_k's.
        So, the algorithm computes all the Z_k's in a single pass (some Z_k's can be deduced directly from previous values of Z_j's; j<k. see 1.3 Gusfield.).
        We can prove the correctness of the algorithm by induction on k. Hence, it runs in O(m + n).

4.  (a) I'm not sure if this is a trick question, but there are several different reasons why there might be sequence differences between the read
        and the reference genome at the read's point of origin, as we discussed in class.
            1. Mutations, changes in nucleotide sequence (damages to DNA due to radiation or chemical mutagens) or errors in replication.
            2. Transpositions, A phenomenon in which a segment of DNA independently replicates itself and inserts the copy into a new position within the same or another chromosome.
            3. Genetic Recombination, occurring naturally, for example, by the pairing of homologous chromosomes in meiosis or by the breaking and rejoining of DNA strands, which forms new molecules of DNA.

5.  (a) Image of light emitted color labelled nucleotides during a cycle of "sequencing by synthesis".
    (b) There is uncertainty because of errors that occur when some templates get “out of sync”, by missing an incorporation or by incorporating 2 or more nucleotides at once.
    (c) Larger fractions of the templates in the cluster fall out of sync as we go along and hence there is more uncertainty in later sequencing cycles.
    (d) 1. medium, since most of the light emitted is of a particular color although intensity is a bit off.
        2. high, no confusion here.
        3. low, the sequencer can't possibly know which of the two colors to pick.

6.  (a) Yes! The 67th nucleotide read (row 67) seems to have a quality score of < 20, 93% of the time!
    (b) See res/graphs.pdf for the plots depicting the trends.

        The number of quality values < 20 gradually increase after a quarter of the nucleotides are read within each read, spiking sharply at the 67th nucleotide.
        After this the uncertainty in the read seems to increase causing the quality of sequence reads to decrease. Also note that the spike in the percentage of
        "other character" reads coincides with the start of increasing error rates. This is because some templates get “out of sync,” by missing an incorporation or
        by incorporating 2 or more nucleotides at once. And, as seen in the graph errors increase in the later sequencing cycles as proportionally more templates
        fall out of sync.
